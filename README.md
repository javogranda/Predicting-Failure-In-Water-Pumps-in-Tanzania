# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table
Our solution approach for the Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/)

We used Dataiku for the Exploratory Data Analysis and then Sklearn Random Forest library to predict the damaged pumps with an accuracy of 81%
